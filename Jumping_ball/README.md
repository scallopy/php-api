1. using PIXI.js , create a simple canvas, a background white color and a jumping ball (up & down, infinite) with gravity taken into consideration:

    - every time the image/ball hits the floor the background color should change randomly.
    - every time you click on the ball it should jump up, no matter what its current movement is, pay attention to gravity.
    - also add a counter on screen which counts the times you clicked on the ball, the counter should be reset when the ball hits the ground.
    - this must be working in both desktop and mobile. 

2. Start server:

    âžœ  Jumping_ball >  python -m http.server

3. Open http://0.0.0.0:8000/
